            <h2 className='subheading-center'>Business Person First, Software Developer Second.</h2>
            <p>
                Joseph has a degree in Accounting and over six years working in corporate accounting.
                During that time, Joseph has seen the ineffeciencies and losses caused by poor
                business processes and clumsey, difficult software.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, as a software developer,
                Joseph strives to bring the same lean and competitive edge enjoyed by companies like Amazon to other
                businesses by building effective and easy to use software systems. Joseph is not just another
                software developer, he is first and foremost a business person - who sees significant competitive
                possibilities with software and the technical expertise to implement it.
            </p>

            <h2 className='subheading-center'>Experience</h2>
            <p>
                After earning his baccalaureate degree in Accounting, Joseph worked as Project Accountant for
                HDR Engineering, an international civil engineering firm, for over six years while learning
                software development. Now, he is a full-time software developer,
                building applications for government agencies at all levels, and for private sector engineering firms.
            </p>
            <p>
                This combination of education, experience, and skills uniquely qualifies Joseph with the ability
                to see how to leverage software for your business's benefit.
