                Joseph spent over 6 years working in corporate accounting. He watched a lot of waste, ineffeciently and
                losses occur because of poor business processes and clumsey, difficult software. Now, as a software developer,
                Joseph strives to bring the same lean and competitive edge enjoyed by companies like Amazon to other
                businesses by building efffective and easy to use software systems.
